# 3D-Summer-Engine (Fluid Simulation)
Currently this project focuses mainly towards 2D graphics at the moment. It has 3D-features implemented already but much time has passed since the last revision, the 3D-features have not yet been tested.

# 2D Fluid Simulation
The purpose of this project is to get a somewhat large pool of understanding about computer graphics such as optimizations by using shaders.

# Usage
To test the simulation you can build the application on your own (But that requires that you have all the libraries on your machine). You can also download the setup file in the releases https://github.com/BoilingT/3D-Summer-Engine/releases (This is the way). 

### Using this content does not gaurantee a fully working product.

# Libraries and Includes
GLFW 3.3.8

GLAD 3.3 core

GLM

# Info

## Configuration File

A configuration file is located where the program is installed. These can be changed to achieve different results. You can enable and disable certain effects and also simulation steps which allows for experimentation. What the settings do is explained inside the configuration file. Be carefull however! There are no limitations to how large values you can set which can greatly affect the performance of your computer and the program itself.

## Modes (Keybindings)

## By pressing *Y* the default view will be shown.
This field displays where dye has been applied.

## By pressing *U* the velocity field will be shown.
This field displays the current velocity field shown with different colors that indicate the magnitude of the velocities in certain directions.

## By pressing *Y* the divergence field will be shown.
This field represents how much the fluid diverges from each cell in the grid.

## By pressing *Y* the pressure field will be shown.
This field displays the pressure in each cell relative to the surrounding cells.

### If you are having trouble it could depend on that the application doesn't have access to where it is installed. A possible solution is to run as *administrator*.

## Have Fun!
