# 3D-Summer-Engine
## Created by *Tobias Andersson*
### Note: 
Currently this project focuses mainly towards 2D graphics at the moment. It has 3D-features implemented already but much time has passed since the last revision, the 3D-features have not yet been tested.

# 2D Fluid Simulation
The purpose of this project is to get a somewhat large pool of understanding about computer graphics such as optimizations by using shaders.
